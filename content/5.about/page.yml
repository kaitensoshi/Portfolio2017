    Ali's from a [little island](https://goo.gl/maps/hLyfp1hsa2J2) just a few degrees of the equator. She was raised by a man who looks like a [bulldog](http://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bulldog-puppy-cute-dog-photography-36__605.jpg) and a woman who [barks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCo5w6qukJY) like one. Ali writes for advertising, design and everything else in between. Ali is called Ali because if you google 'Alicia Tan Writer', she is not the first hit. Ali Tan however, is an [Eastern European singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UarF3uvfwqU) and that's a much better Google Search Result. She studied English Literature and [Japanese Studies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uROMTzJsfOI) at the National University of Singapore (in Singapore) and Waseda University in Tokyo. She did __not__ graduate from any advertising programme or portfolio school. She has, however, been published in Ceriph (Math Paper Press), COAST (Math Paper Press) and exhibited her works in Tokyo.

    She currently works with - the crazy people at Kinetic Design & Advertising
    She used to work with - Blak Labs, Geometry Global and Ogilvy
